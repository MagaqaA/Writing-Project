# What I Do In My Free Time
**I spend my free time mostly reading. The genres of books that I prefer to indulge in are dystopian and fantasy, science fiction, horror, and a bit of romance. I love reading because it is a metaphoric and fulfilling experience that exposes my mind and opens doors beyond my understanding and realm. Reading has gotten me through some tough times, so it will always be special to me beyond just being an escape. I also love listening to music and watching movies, as cliche as it may sound. I see music as something that heals the soul, like a balm. Music is truly powerful as it evokes so many different emotions, such as confidence, sadness, and hopefulness, not to mention nostalgia. I indulge in a spectrum of genres, such as alternative, R&B, amapiano, pop, hip-hop, drill, jazz, soul, classical, and more recently, phonk, which would fall under the alternative umbrella. I enjoy movies purely for fun, which is why I refuse to watch any movies that might make me cry in any way, so that means absolutely no romance, war, or just any movies with sad notes in them. This goes for a series as well. Additionally, I have a strong love for and interest in horses. I think they are very majestic and beautiful creatures. One day, I hope to own a ranch so I can have my own horses.**
