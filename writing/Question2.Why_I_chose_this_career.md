# Why I Want This Career
**What attracts me to Data Science is the manner in which the field is interdisciplinary, meaning it combines skills and expertise from multiple different areas of study, mainly computer science, mathematics, and statistics. The way that these areas of study are all interwoven to ultimately produce one main field means that one gets to be exposed and acquianted to many different skills and knowledge, so much so that it inspires versatility, innovation, creativity, ensures one's ability to be adaptable to evolving technologies, and ensures continuous learning. This is ultimately what inspired my decision, because why wouldnâ€™t anyone want to be a part of such an intricate field that allows for a well-rounded understanding, analysis, and solving of complex problems? This is not to mention the vast and endless opportunities within the field, as Data Science is applicable to many industries, including banking and finance, healthcare, marketing, and, of course, technology. I specifically applied for this course because I want to learn and master the concepts of Data Sceince, and ultimately build a strong career with longevity in Data Science. I want to leave an impact in the field and be someone whose work will be recognised for solving complex problems and driving innovation in the ever-changing world of technology.**
