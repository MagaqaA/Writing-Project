# My Routine
* **My routine:** I mostly work at night, 4-5 hours per night, every day of the week. These are the quiet hours at home, so they are most suitable for me. I start at 22:00PM, so it would be: 22:00PM-02:00/03:00AM (Monday to Sunday).
* I do not plan on how many cards I have to go through every night; I just do as much as I possibly can while pacing myself and ensuring that I understand and get practice if needed.
* I go from the card that is at the top; basically, I work in a “going down the ladder” motion.
* I take one break during this time, which is a 15-minute break at 1:00 AM.
* The next day, every day, I always make sure to check whether I have been reviewed or need to review a colleague's submission. I do this around 11:00 a.m.–13:00 p.m.
